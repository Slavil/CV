        <h1 class="heading">Slavil Bachvarov</h1>
        <p>For the last year and a half i have been completing courses in SoftUni for a purpose. When i quited the bank
            sector in the beggining of 2020 i decided to develop myself in a new direction and software developer
            sounded the right thing for me. After almost two years i have completed the JS
            Basics, Python Basics, JS Fundamentals, JS Advanced and the HTML & CSS course. Currently i signed up for The
            JS Web module and starting to learn Java. I am eager to learn and think that if i start as an intern, i
            would learn a lot more very quickly and bring more benefits to my future employer. 
            In addition i have good knowledge of MS Office, my past experience working in banks thought me to be proactive, 
            problem-solving and how to manage my time according to tasks.
